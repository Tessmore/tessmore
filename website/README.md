## What is "tessmore"?

It's my artist/online name derived from "Tesselaar" (my lastname). I intend to
host (some) pictures of arts and crafts I made. Possibly some blog posts, but
who has time for writing those :(

## Art tips

* Youtube has plenty of videos of mixing acrylic paint and getting nice abstract
  shapes and colors. Mixing lights with some darks and finish with some
  gold/silver dust for nice effects
* Covering the canvas in white (or a color) using a putty knife is pretty fast.
You have to be careful not to press through the canvas with the sharp edges...
